            <section class="bioBox">Daenerys Targaryen is the daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen (also referred to as "The Mad King") and his sister-wife Queen Rhaella, and is one of the last survivors of House Targaryen. She serves as the third-person narrator of 31 chapters
                throughout A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Dance with Dragons, the fourth most in the series behind Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Arya Stark, respectively. She is the only monarch or claimant to a throne
                given point of view chapters in the novels, a choice that George R.R. Martin has indicated was deliberate.</section>
